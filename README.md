# Comp_Genomics
Repository for the final Computational Genomics project, analyzing gliomas.

Please include in your report a pointer to a GitHub repo or equivalent (SourceForge etc.)  that includes the project software files:

- All source code/scripts
- Sample, small (see below) input and output files
- If your project generally operates on large (see below) data files that are available publically, list the names of these files and where to get them.
- A ReadMe file that tells exactly 
    - what is each file, 
    - how to compile (if relevant) and test-run the project on sample inputs to get the sample output, 
    - how to really run the project on large files, if relevant, 
    - what are the parameters, 
    - what are the system requirements (e.g. are you using a particular version of MatLab/Python/R/Ruby/Java/C++/Cobol? Do you run on a particularly powerful machine/cloud instance? Which standard or add-on libraries would you need to have been
previously installed?)
